# Hi, I'm Yeongjin Lee 👋

I am an undergraduate researcher at **VCMI Lab, Seoul Women’s University (South Korea)**, working on **medical image segmentation** with foundation models.  
I am interested in **remote research internship opportunities** starting in **2026**.

My current research focuses on **zero-shot bowel segmentation** in **Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE)**.
