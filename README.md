## Hi, I'm Yeongjin (Jin) Lee 👋

I am an undergraduate researcher at **VCMI Lab, Seoul Women’s University**, working on **medical image segmentation** with a focus on **foundation models** and **reproducible pipelines**.

My current research centers on **zero-shot bowel segmentation in MRE**, analyzing how pretrained models (e.g., MRSegmentator) behave on heterogeneous clinical data and addressing their limitations through robust preprocessing.

## 🧪 Current Research & Highlights

### **Zero-shot Bowel Segmentation on MRE**
*Investigating the robustness of foundation models on raw clinical data.*
- **Key Problem**: Performance degradation due to anisotropic voxel spacing and protocol variability in Crohn's disease datasets.
- **Approach**: Designed an end-to-end pipeline using **nnU-Net** with isotropic resampling and morphological post-processing.
- **Impact**: Improved segmentation performance (**Dice Score: 69.5 → 81.0**) and applied the pipeline to cohort-level clinical data analysis.
