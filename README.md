## Hi, I'm Yeongjin Lee 👋

I am an undergraduate researcher at VCMI Lab, Seoul Women’s University, working on medical image segmentation with a focus on foundation models.

My current research centers on zero-shot bowel segmentation in MRE, studying how pretrained models (e.g., MRSegmentator) behave in practical clinical settings and addressing their limitations through robust preprocessing.

## 🧪 Current Research & Highlights

### **Zero-shot Bowel Segmentation on MRE**
*Investigating the robustness of foundation models in practical clinical settings.*
- **Key Problem**: Performance degradation due to anisotropic voxel spacing and protocol variability in Crohn’s disease MRE.
- **Approach**: Applied **MRSegmentator** in a zero-shot setting with tailored preprocessing, including isotropic resampling and morphological post-processing.
- **Impact**: Improved segmentation performance (**Dice Score: 69.5 → 81.0**) and applied the pipeline to cohort-level clinical data analysis.
